It's the day I've waited  
for & studied for  

I do the form in my  
best handwriting-but  
not good enough for  
my father who doesn't  
want to feel embarrassed  
& so he takes out  
his pen & writes  
my stuff all over  
again real nice  

I enter the car with  
a man named Bill  
or bob I think  

He says he was me  
he was sitting where I  
was 20 years ago &  
he knows what it's like  
he tells me that I don't  
have to be like him  
& says drive now  

Keep on driving don't  
stop ill tell you where  
to go-we'll live someplace  
new-we can split  
ways once we get their  
but kid GO & DONT STOP  
DRIVING NOW YOU  
JUST GOTTA GO  
& DRIVE & NEVER  
STOP  
and don't ever stop  
they are gonna come  
-I know your dad  
by looks-he looks  
like a real hardass  
the type to secretly  
care for you & call  
all sorts of people to  
find  and locate you  
& me-we might never be safe  
-we might never  
get the chance to  
stop or rest or  
pause for a beat  
But it's better than  
the ratrace that  
society puts us  
in it's better than  
this country & society  
where people are  
never happy & you  
live a fake life to  
impress people &  
you can never  
just be yourself  
you can never  
just sit in a chair  
& stop & think  
& live & laugh  
& they condition  
us from young  
age you know  
that it's true-they  
brainwash us &  
tell us these lies  
on tv & movies &  
it's all fucking  
bullshit-we don't  
run our lives-  
we never have  
they do-
they run everything  
-all we can do  
now is DRIVE-
