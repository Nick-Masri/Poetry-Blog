The other day I am walking to   
breakfast with Teddy it’s a nice day   
and we cross the street   
easily as there is little traffic  

I head up the stairs to plastic  
sounding plates and to melancholic   
tables where I place the plastic plates   
and beyond my eye is the sunish top I  
 know too well and Teddy doesn’t notice at   
first but soon he whispers and says look it’s her  

And I knew it was her and I tried not to care even   
though I wish the table was empty or someone   
else was there but she was still there and I   
was still caring even though I wanted to   
see and care for the other one who I   
never see and never can even when  
 I try and I guess I will wait  

Until the day I stop caring  
and seeing and simply  
talk with Teddy
