Last night I met a girl  
with two weeks left  
We brought a kid pool  
filled with small and large  
plastic balls meant to be a  
satire of consumerism or  
something like that  
across the street  
with cars looking at  
that fantastic sight  
and we brought it to  
the dumpster near my dorm  
and you made fun of  
environmentalists  
and called me a hopeless enthusiast  
and we poured the plastic  
balls into the dumpster  
and heard something move  
and picked up the balls  
that had fell  
and threw them in  
and we deflated the kid pool  
or did we-I can't remember  
and you said you saw something  
near the dumpster  
you saw legs  
man legs-racoon legs  
real legs moving and rattled  
by the plastic balls  
but I didn't see it  
I was too distracted  
looking at someone I wished  
I had more time with and I wished
I didn't have sign-in and I could stay up  
till 3am on a Wednesday morning  
with you  
looking at the stars  
and when I woke up  
my two weeks were gone  
I was neither hopeless nor enthusiastic  
and all I had to remember you  
were more CVS points on my account  
and a Simon and Garfunkel song  
you said you liked
