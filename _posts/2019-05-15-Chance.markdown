It was just by great chance  
She was in my math class  
Just by great chance I  
Switched into that class  
At around the same time  
As she did and could get  
To know her  

It was just by great chance  
That I was a complete idiot  
Just by great chance did I fall  
For someone else who I thought  
Had fallen for me  

It was just by great chance  
I was busy my entire second year  
Just by great chance I couldn't  
Find any time  

It was just by great chance  
That in the fall I was still  
Very busy and just by great  
Chance in the winter I was  
Snowed in-blockaded by my mind  

And it's just by great chance  
That I am about to graduate  
And it's just by great chance  
That I might never see her again  

So if I might-just this one time  
Not put it up to chance  
And by great will  
Take a leap while I still have  
this great chance
