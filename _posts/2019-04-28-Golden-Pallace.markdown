The palace once stood up  
high and tall. The floors  
shined with promise,  
the chambers echoed with hope.  
Until the roots and vines poured  
into the grand palace. The palace lost its bright  
white color--and sharp right angles. The floors  
began to collapse and erase  
leaving only the firepit Until  
only a single ash remained-the wind, once blocked  
from the quiet interior, grabbed the ash and brought  
it to the vines. And the wind kept blowing and blowing-  
until the house was burning and then collapsed. A tree  
near by dropped an acorn and made a new palace.
