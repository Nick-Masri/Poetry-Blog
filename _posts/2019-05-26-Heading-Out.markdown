I'll be leaving now  
It's my time to go  
I can't stay here forever  
Waiting for you to come  
I'll be fine for a while  
Might even be good for a bit  
But it's all bullshit  
There will always be  
Someplace for you in my heart  
And who knows  
Maybe while I'm on the road  
I'll find someone new  
Or maybe I'll think of you  
And be strangled by blue
