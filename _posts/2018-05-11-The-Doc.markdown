A poem a day, the doc  
says. Just one a day  
that's all it is that's   
all it ever is. Prescriptions  
are bad, your dad says.  
Poets are unemployed your  
mom says. What do they  
know. So, you take your  
prescription, first reluctantly,   
while doubting it, just   
following doctors orders.   
But nothing changes. So you  
take more, you write all   
you think, your mind is in  
a black notebook by  
mead. You feel it now, you   
feel the surge following through  
you, it's electric so you take  
more. You take too much...  
You OD on your prescription,  
Your parents are next to you  
and you look to your dad  
who says: "I told you so"  
And he did. He told you before  
and you didn't listen. And  
now you are back at square  
one meeting with your  
doctor, but this time your  
parents are there,   
making sure he doesn't  
assign you the same  
prescription, and he  
assigns you something   
new, and as you leave  
he says to you  
that you dropped  
something and right  
by your shoe is a  
prescription for a  
poem a day
