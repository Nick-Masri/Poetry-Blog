The Great New Age  
They say  
We are here  
They say  
We made it  
So let's celebrate  
Let's party all day  
For we made it to  
The very best we can be  

And leading the party  
Are the Great Americans  
With a very rambunctious Alabaman  
All proud that he just outlawed abortion  
He used to be an alcoholic  
But he says he's all better  
Because he's in the Great New Age  

In the Great New Age Party  
We laugh about poverty  
We laugh about rape  
We laugh about crime  
We laugh about bad education  
Remember when we used to  
Have those problems we say  

And everyone envies the great Americans  
Pioneers who in 2016 started the Great  
Age movement  

And with a grin on our faces  
We drink till the bottle is all done  
Knowing we have won and the people  
Will do nothing
