Orthogonality she says-
it's helpful to find
minimums she says-
it has a lot of applications
it is seen everywhere-
it can solve problems
of great magnitude.

where was orthogonality
when people were starving
where was orthogonality
when people overdosed
on oxycotton eagerly
given by people sitting
in their mansions
where was orthogonality
when people rationed
off their insulin
because they couldn't
afford the high price
where was orthogonality
when we pay 80,000
for someone to stay in
jail and we say education
is to expensive
