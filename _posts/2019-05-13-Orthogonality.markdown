Orthogonality she says-  
it's helpful to find  
minimums she says-  
it has a lot of applications  
it is seen everywhere-  
it can solve problems  
of great magnitude.

yet I  
raise my hand and I say  
what about world hunger?  
-isn't that still a thing  
why don't we solve that   
before we make games  
and tv episodes?
