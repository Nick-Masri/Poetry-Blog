So sure you were when  
you were broke. When others  
said against it, told you  
stop, told you you were  
throwing your life away,  
you kept going. You even told  
yourself, you said it is fine  
it is good, it will work  
like before. But then it didn't,  
and now you don't,  
and you wonder why  
and that's that, and now  
you think maybe they  
were right but don't think  
you think to yourself, just  
go out there and run  
barefoot.
